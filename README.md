Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data 

This repository contains the script and the result files to complete the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data, which is part for the Data Science Specialization.

The file run_analysis.R contains the commands used to solve the following assignment:

'One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing
see for example this article. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing 
to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the 
course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
of each variable for each activity and each subject.'

## run_analysis.R
The R file contains the code to solve the assignment and an explanation of the commands.

## CodeBook.md
The file CodeBook.md contains the code and similar explanations as in run_analyisis.R but it is markdown format.

## Results
The text files are the output files to complete the assignment.
